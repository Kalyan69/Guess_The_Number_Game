 Import the Required Module:

 First, you need to import the random module to generate a random number. This module contains functions for generating random numbers.


Generate a Random Number:

Next, generate a random number between 1 and 10. This number will be the one the user tries to guess.  "random_number = random.randint(1, 10)"

Start the Guessing Loop:
Use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user to guess the number until they get it right. This loop will run indefinitely until the correct guess is made.
while  True :

Get User Input and Handle Errors:

 input("Please guess a number between 1 to 10: ") displays a prompt to the user and waits for input.
 int(input(...)) attempts to convert the user input to an integer.
 If the input is not a valid integer, a ValueError will be raised, and the except block will execute:

 except ValueError: catches the specific exception when the input is not an integer.
 print("Please provide an integer.") informs the user of the mistake.

Check the User's Guess
If the input is valid and converted to an integer, check if it matches the generated random number. If it matches, break out of the loop.

if user_guess == random_number: checks if the user's guess is equal to the generated random number.
break exits the while loop when the condition is me
